**âš  Please note:**
This is an unfinished fork of Chemfish (Kale) under development.
It is being heavily refactored, and most tests are missing. Do not use it.

To install, first install and configure [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/).
Then run:

```bash
pip install chemfish
chemfish init
```

The second command will prompt you and configure Chemfish with a new database
or the database from the [OSF repository](https://osf.io/nyhpc/).
[See the docs](https://chemfish.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more help.

To build and test locally (with MariaDB installed):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/chemfish.git
cd chemfish
pip install tox
tox
```

The `tox.ini` assumes that the root MariaDB password is `root`. Just modify this line if needed:

```ini
mysql -e 'SOURCE tests/resources/testdb.sql;' --host=127.0.0.1 --user=root --password=root
```
